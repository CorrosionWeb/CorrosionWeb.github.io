This site support IoT integration of microcontrollers with WiFi-modules. With this in mind this has been developed for Teensy 3.5 with a ESP8266-1 WiFi module. Therefore any differences in microcontroller coding and setup protocols should be kept in mind before attempting to using the programmed setup.
